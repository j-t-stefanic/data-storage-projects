# List Of Projects

  - **SQLite**
    #### I have used SQLite since back in 2015 when I created an iOS app for a contract employer which used SQLITE for persistent data storage, directly accessible by the application. In 2023 I had scraped a tremendous amount of NFL data to perform some Exploratory Data Analysis as well as to practice creating some data visualization projects.


 - **MySQL**
   #### I have used MySQL since at least 2017 when I started storing data related to wines I drank and began development of an iOS app to track the wines we tasted at our Wine Tasting Group started by my wife.


 - **SQL Server**
   #### I have used SQL Server since at least 2010 when I was creating automation projects at my employer Medco Health Solutions.  One project was centered on Major medical Claims analysis to model savings opportunities using our existing and proven Pharmacy Benefit Management claims processing protocols.  I created a HCPCS to NDC matching program which allowed for potential savings analysis to share with our clients.  



 - **MongoDB**

   #### With a lot of experience using SQL and SQL based databases it was time to learn about NoSQL document databases, which store data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON.  I began learning MongoDB from books like "Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node (Simon Holmes), and "Seven databases in seven weeks" (Luc Perkins), as well as enrolling in the MongoDB University program at learn.mongodb.com online.
